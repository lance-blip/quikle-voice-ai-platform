## How to Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Push via Command Line (Recommended)

Since the remote is already configured, you just need to authenticate and push:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/quikle-voice-ai-platform
git push github master
```

You'll be prompted for:
- **Username**: `lance-blip`
- **Password**: Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password)

#### Creating a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Quikle Voice Platform"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and use it as your password when pushing

### Option 2: Download and Push Locally

1. Download the entire project from the Manus interface
2. Extract to your local machine
3. Navigate to the directory
4. Push to GitHub:

```bash
cd path/to/quikle-voice-ai-platform
git remote add github https://github.com/lance-blip/quikle-voice-ai-platform.git
git push github master
```

## Troubleshooting

- Check that the repository exists at the URL

**Error: "Remote already exists"**
- The remote is already configured, just run `git push github master`
